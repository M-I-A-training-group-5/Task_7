# Why we Selected A DC Brushed Motor

The decision to use a DC brushed motor for the Autonomous Planet Cleaner (APC) machine was based on the following reasons:

1. **Suitability for Vacuuming:** DC brushed motors are known for having reliable and effective performance in vacuuming applications, making them well-suited for waste collection and debris removal tasks.

2. ** Constant Pulse: ** DC motors are well known for providing a constant output making sure that the vacuum is consistently working with a constant output.

3. ** High Speeds: ** DC motors are also known for having a very high speed and are often used in propellers and other tasks that require high torque.  

4. **Availability:** DC brushed motors are widely available in the market, and there is abundant knowledge and expertise in working with them, facilitating procurement, troubleshooting, and maintenance.

5. **Cost effective** DC brushed motors have a lower initial cost compared to brushless motors, making them a more budget-friendly option for the APC machine.

These reasons led to the selection of a DC brushed motor, providing a cost-effective, simple, and suitable solution for efficient cleaning operations.
