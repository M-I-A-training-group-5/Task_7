# Cytron Motor Controller using Exponential smoothing Filter

## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of the code used to control a motor using a Cytron motor driver, including the implementation of an Exponential Smoothing Filter for precise motor speed control

# Brief about cytron

It’s a motor driver which mainly contains of 2 pins, one of which is a digital pin which controls motor’s direction **(CW or CCW)** and the other is a PWP pin which controls motor’s speed.

## Code Overview

### Pin Configuration

- `motorPWM`: PWM pin (Pin 9) for motor speed control.
- `motorDirection`: Digital pin (Pin 8) for motor direction control.

### Global Variables

- `currentSpeed`: Current motor speed.
- `targetSpeed`: Target motor speed.
- `alpha`: Smoothing factor for filtering (used in exponential smoothing).
- `millisDelay`: Delay interval in milliseconds for applying the filter.
- `previousMillis`: Stores the last time the `startFilter` function was called.

### `setup()` Function

- Configures `motorPWM` and `motorDirection` pins as outputs.
- Initializes serial communication with a baud rate of 9600.

### `loop()` Function

- Checks if input is available from the serial monitor.
- If input is available, updates `targetSpeed` with the new value.
- Calls the `startFilter` function at a regular interval to control the motor.

### `startFilter()` Function

- Applies an exponential smoothing filter to make motor speed changes gradual.
- Updates `currentSpeed` based on the filter.
- Calls the `controlMotor` function to control the motor based on the filtered speed.

### `controlMotor()` Function

- Controls the motor's speed and direction.
- If `currentSpeed` is negative, the motor rotates clockwise.
- If `currentSpeed` is positive or zero, the motor rotates anticlockwise.

# Additional Simulation

For a more in-depth understanding of how the exponential smoothing filter works, you can refer to this [Jupyter Notebook](calculating freq and alpha.ipynb). This notebook includes a simulation that demonstrates the filter's behavior and its application to achieve precise control of a variable over time.

The Jupyter file contains Python code that simulates the behavior of the smoothing filter, allowing you to visualize how it affects a variable's response to changes in a target value. It provides a complementary perspective to the Arduino code presented above.

# DC Brushed Motor suitability for this application

DC brushed motors can be suitable for some vacuum applications, but their suitability depends on the specific requirements of the application and the environmental conditions in which they will be used.

**Advantages of DC brushed motors for vacuum applications:**

1. `Cost-effective:` DC brushed motors have a lower initial cost compared to brushless motors, making them a more budget-friendly option for the machine.
   
2. `Constant Pulse:` DC motors are well known for providing a constant output making sure that the vacuum is consistently working with a constant output.

3. `Size:` DC brushed motors are generally compact, which can be advantageous in applications where space is limited.

4. `Easy to control:` DC brushed motors are easy to control in terms of speed and direction, which can be important in vacuum applications.

**However, there are also some limitations and considerations to keep in mind:**

1. `Brush wear`: DC brushed motors have brushes that make physical contact with the commutator, and over time, these brushes can wear out. In a vacuum environment, dust and debris can accelerate brush wear, potentially leading to maintenance issues.

2. `Efficiency:` DC brushed motors may not be as energy-efficient as some other motor types, which can be a concern in applications where power consumption is a critical factor.
   
3. `Heat generation:` DC brushed motors can generate heat during operation. In vacuum applications the heat generated by the motor may need to be managed to prevent overheating of sensitive components or materials.
## Conclusion

The provided Arduino code allows you to control the speed and direction of a motor using the serial monitor. The use of an exponential smoothing filter helps make speed transitions smooth and gradual, which can be beneficial in various applications.
